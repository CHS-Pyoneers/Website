                The Pyoneers Club leads two main efforts: teaching and organizing competitions.
                We currently lead beginner and advanced lessons at the following schools:
                <br/><br/>&nbsp;{' > '}Burleigh Manor Middle School
                <br/>&nbsp;{' > '}Dunloggin Middle School
                <br/>&nbsp;{' > '}Centennial High School
                <br/><br/>and have been doing so since 2020! Topics involving anything from basic print statements to advanced object-oriented principles have been covered in these lessons. Alongside that, we have organized three Centennial Informatics Tournaments (CInTs), where contestants solve USACO-esque problems for cash prizes.
